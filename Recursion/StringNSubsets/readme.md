Generate All Subsets Of A Set
Generate All Subsets Of A Set

Generate ALL possible subsets of a given set. The set is given in the form of a string s containing distinct lowercase characters 'a' - 'z'.

Example
Input: "xy" 

Output: ["", "x", "y", "xy"] 

Notes
Input Parameters: There is only one argument denoting string s.

Output: Return array of strings res, containing ALL possible subsets of given string. You need not to worry about order of strings in your output array. E.g. s = "a", arrays ["", "a"] and ["a", ""]  both will be accepted.
Order of characters in any subset must be same as in the input string. For s = "xy", array ["", "x", "y", "xy"] will be accepted, but ["", "x", "y", "yx"] will not be accepted. 

Constraints:
•	0 <= |s| <= 20
•	s only contains distinct lowercase alphabetical letters ('a' - 'z').

Empty set is a subset of any set.
Any set is a subset of itself.

Custom Input
Input Format: The first and only line of input should contain a string s, denoting the input string.
If s = “xy”, then input should be: xy

Output Format: Let’s denote the size of res as m, where res is the resultant array of strings returned by the solution function.
Then, there will be m lines of output, where ith line contains string at index i of res.

For input s = “xy”, output will be:
----------- START of output -----------

x
y
xy
----------- END of output ---------------
(Note that the first line of output is an empty line, corresponding to empty set [“”].)
